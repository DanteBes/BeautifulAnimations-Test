I'm a developer working on mobile, creating websites using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without libraries or frameworks. I enjoy adding unique visual effects and strive to understand every detail of the code to gain experience.

**About the Project**  
This project includes animated cards with smooth color transitions and other visual effects. I initially planned to animate the heading with a color-shifting effect, but for now, only the cards are animated. More updates and improvements to the animations are in progress.
